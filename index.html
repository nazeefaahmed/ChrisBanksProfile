  		After working in community service and advocacy, Banks first ran for local government in 2012 against Inez Barron for the state’s 60th District Assembly seat. After loosing by 598 votes, he challenged Inez Barron and her husband politician Charles Barron four more times times, finally toppling Charles in the 2023.

			In an interview with Chris Banks, I documented what he has seen change over the years, what he has done since taking office, and what he sees some problems being in the coming years.

					<h2>About East New York/Starett City </h2>
					<p> 
						All of the data below was taken from the <a href="https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/east-new-york-starrett-city"> NYU Furman Center Neighborhood Profiles</a> 
						
			    	<li>In 2023, there were an estimated 190,021 people in East New York/Starrett City, with the majority identifying as Black or Hispanic.</li>
			    	<li>In the past 15 years, 81% of new units in buildings with more than 4 units were made for low-income tenents. That number is only 22% in Brooklyn as a whole.</li>
			    	<li>There are 733 properties in these communities with subsidized units, with the majority of them expiring in 2041.</li>
			    	<li>The crime rate per 1000 residents is higher then Brooklyn's and city-wide as well.</li>

			<h2>Banks wants other community districts to take on the city's shelter burden.</h2>
			<p>
				In New York City, public services and facilities require equal distribution ever since the "Fair Share" rules were adopted by the city in the early 1990s. This means that communities should have an equal proportion of fire stations while also sharing an equal burden of rehabilitation and homelss shelters.
			</p>

			<p>

				A <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/audit-report-on-new-york-citys-compliance-with-fair-share/"> 2023 audit report</a> on New York City's compliance with Fair Share found that the Brownsville area had the second highest concentration of homeless shelters, with 3,914 total beds. In contrast, other parts of Brooklyn have none, including Brooklyn Community District 10 (Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights) and Brooklyn Community District 11 (Bensonhurst, Bath Beach). 
			</p>

			<p>
				"You can't just dump on one community, and that's what the major concern is that we have with the whole shelter issue," said Banks, adding that the violated the Fair Share policy by turning to emergency powers such as during Hurricane Sandy and the assylum crisis.

			<h2>He's against the Congestion Pricing Tolling Plan</h2>
			<p>
				The Congestion Pricing Toll Plan charges $9 a day to enter congested roads in Manhattan, increasing to $12 in 2028 and $15 in 2031. The goal of this system was to use the tolls to fund MTA repair. Though tolls bring ithe city approximately 40 million per month, the subway fares are going up to $3 in January 2026. 
			</p>

			<p>

				Banks issued a statement in January opposing the toll because "it is another tax on working and middle-class New Yorkers." 
			</p>


				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My official statement regarding this week’s implementation of the Congestion Pricing Toll Plan affecting those who drive into Manhattan’s Central Business District below 60th Street. <a href="https://t.co/0TUngeKfOr">pic.twitter.com/0TUngeKfOr</a></p>&mdash; Councilmember Chris Banks (@CMCHRISBANKS42) <a href="https://twitter.com/CMCHRISBANKS42/status/1877353265785929904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

				His district falls into a section of Brooklyn with around one car per household, the highest in the borough, according to a report from <a href="https://www.hunterurban.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Car-Light-NYC-Studio-May-2024.pdf">Urban Planning at Hunter College</a>.

	<h2>Banks manages day-to-day concerns of affordable housing developments</h2>
	<p>In 2024, CD 42 saw the <a href="https://citylimits.org/heres-where-affordable-housing-was-built-last-year-where-it-wasnt/">greatest number of new affordable units</a>. in New York City at 1439, which Banks credits to his predecessor's work on the Gateway Project. Now, parking has become a concern because the streets are not currently regulated and do not have alternate street parking rules. Banks is in conversation with the Housing Preservation Development to transfer the streets to the Department of Transportation, so that the streets can be regulated again. Then, sanitation workers can keep the streets clean. 

	</p>

	<p>
		"Maintaining the housing and dealing with some of the existing infrastructure, there are issues that we are constantly bringing to DOT and sanation," said Banks."This may not be big issues to the broader city but these are these are big issues in this section of the 42nd Council district." 



  	
<section class="content-block">
	<h2>Some successes from the past year</h2>

	<p>
		Banks secured millions in funding for capital projets and schools in the district.
